Moreover, the company has enhanced its SOAR capabilities in recent months to include upgraded threat intelligence and automation. 

# Opensource
## 1. Cynet 360
Cynet is an IR platform – free to use for incident responders. It  provides incident responders with a complete set of remediation actions to address infected hosts, malicious files, attacker-controlled network traffic, and compromised user accounts. With Cynet 360, IR teams can get complete visibility of their environment in less than one hour—and it only takes one click to remediate attacks. The central management allows you to distribute other open-source incident response across the environment, and you can build your own remediation policies for automated threat blocking and removal. You can also see the attack scope and all indicators immediately, which vastly reduces investigation time.

## 2. GRR Rapid Response

Google’s GRR Rapid Response framework allows analysts to conduct remote live forensics. It also helps IR teams respond in a swift and scalable manner for faster triage and remote analysis. It’s comprised of two parts: the GRR client, which is deployed on the system to be investigated, and the GRR server, which helps analysts implement actions and process the data they have collected.

## 3. AlienVault

AlienVault OSSIM (Open Source Security Information and Event Management) is an SIEM tool that helps analysts get a comprehensive view of their system. It does this by providing log and asset management, with information from other security tools to gain context.

## 4. Cyphon
Cyphon provides analysts with tools to collect, process, and triage incidents. It collects data from sources such as message logs, APIs, and email—and makes it simple to analyze while allowing you to collect as much or little data as you need.

## 5. Volatility
This popular memory forensics framework allows analysts to investigate and extract intelligence from volatile memory dumps. Volatility provides data on network connections, processes that are running, process IDs, and more—and exports that data to a text file.

## 6. Sans Investigative Forensics Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation
SIFT Workstation is an Ubuntu-based toolkit that comes with everything analysts need to execute in-depth digital forensic investigations. It can also be downloaded as a VMware appliance.

## 7. TheHive Project
TheHive Project is a free open-source IR platform that allows multiple analysts to work simultaneously on incident investigations. It gives analysts the ability to set up notifications for new task assignments and to preview new events and alerts with multiple sources, such as email digests and SIEM alerts. Built-in templates allow analysts to gain key insights and identify the right measures to take for faster remediation.
